   *There are a few ways you can do this:*  
   - Run `npm start` in terminal (this will host the website locally from your machine using Node)  
   - Run `vercel dev` in terminal (This will use the Vercel CLI and prompt you in terminal to use y/n and arrow keys to select your project)

6. **Pushing Changes**
